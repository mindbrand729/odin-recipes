        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt</li>

    <br>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large skillet over medium heat, cook the ground beef, onion, and garlic until brown.</li>
        <li>Add the tomato sauce, tomato paste, salt, and oregano and simmer for 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook the lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Drain noodles and rinse with cold water. In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining salt, and Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
        <li>Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with one-half of the ricotta cheese mixture.</li>
        <li>Top with a third of mozzarella cheese. Repeat layers and top with remaining mozzarella cheese.</li>
        <li>Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray, or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil, and bake an additional 25 minutes.</li>
        <li>Cool for 15 minutes before serving.
