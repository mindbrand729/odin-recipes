Hello Odin Project...

In this project I will try to make a website of cooking recipes.

The objective of creating this project is to learn the basic concepts of HTML, so the page will be in principle like those in Web 1.0.

With this project I want to be able to understand how to make web pages that are increasingly better and more dynamic.
